          I created this progress tracker app to help you track your progress
          related to any goal you have in mind. You just have to enter the goal
          and a calendar to track your progress will be created. Whenever you
          want to start afresh, you can click on the clear button in the end.

          I created this expense tracker with JavaScript. With this, you can
          track your expenses for as long as you wish. You can also export the
          records as a .csv file and clear the records whenever you wish!

          Yellow is one of the most under used colors in my designs. And as a
          designer, I like taking risks to see where the designs take me, which
          is why I went ahead and created this yellow-themed website as a
          personal project.

          having easy navigation and colors that suit my design style.
